This project is an ASP.NET MVC C# implementation of the PayPal Express Checkout Process.

The main PayPalMVC library wraps the PayPal API NVP Express Checkout Requests/Responses as objects.

It includes a fully functional sample MVC Web Application that implements the library to make Express Checkout Payments.

It was inspired by work from Jeremy Skinner and Mark Embling who created an excellent SagePayMVC implementation
