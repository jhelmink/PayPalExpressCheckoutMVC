This project is an ASP.NET MVC implementation of the PayPal Express Checkout Process.

It includes a fully functional sample MVC Web Application that can be used to make Express Checkout Payments.

It was inspired by work from Jeremy Skinner (http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk) and Mark Embling (http://www.markembling.info)
They created an excellent SagePayMVC implementation (https://github.com/JeremySkinner/SagePayMvc)
