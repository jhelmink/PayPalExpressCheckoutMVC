Getting Started:

To get the Sample MVC3 App running you'll need to get a sandbox merchant account then modify the web.config and enter your details there. That's it, you should now be able to make some test transactions with the app.


Integrating the Library into your App:

Within the PayPalMVC Library itself there are only a couple of things you should be aware of;

* Configuration.cs - this contains the hard coded Live/Sandbox API addresses and API version number which may eventually need to change.
* Logging.cs - you'll probably want to add your favourite logger here, currently writes to Trace output.
* The Request and Response objects - they do not contain every single possible property listed in the PayPal documentation as most were not applicable for a simple implementation. You can easily add any you might need to these objects.

Using the SampleMVC3WebApplication;

* web.config - you'll need to copy the <payPal> ... </payPal> configuration section into your web.config (don't forget the <section name="payPal" ... /> key in the <configSections> too).
* TransactionService.cs - this uses the PayPalMVC Library and allows you to store the transactions results in your application database. You should be able to use a modified copy of this in your actual application as the interface between your app and the PayPalMVC Library. You should modify it to accept your applications purchase object (cart/basket/item).
* PurchaseController.cs - you'll probably want to copy/modify this as the base for your purchase Actions.
* Purchase Views - you'll need all these views (or your own versions) to match the Actions in the PurchaseController.
* WebUILogging.cs - use your favourite logger here.
